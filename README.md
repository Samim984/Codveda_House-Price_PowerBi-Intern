House Price Prediction: From Market Overview to Price Discovery — A Data Story

📊 Power BI | Business Analytics | Data Storytelling

---

📌 Overview

This project transforms the House Price Prediction dataset into a real-world real estate analytics and decision-support system, developed as Task 2 during my Power BI Internship at Codveda.

Rather than treating house price prediction purely as a machine-learning problem, this dashboard reframes the dataset into a business-driven analytical product, enabling users to explore market trends, price drivers, and scenario-based price estimation.

The project connects:

Property characteristics (rooms, size, age)

Neighborhood attributes (crime level, tax, job proximity, river access)

Market-level price behavior

User-driven price discovery scenarios

Analytical validation of pricing drivers

The result is a multi-page, executive-ready Power BI dashboard that demonstrates how data can support pricing, sales advisory, and investment decisions in the real estate domain.
